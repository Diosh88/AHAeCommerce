## Status Legend

| Status | Entry Count | Meaning | Claude Behavior |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **EMPTY** | 0 | No entries yet | MUST say "No institutional memory exists for [domain] yet. Proceeding with caution." |
| **SPARSE** | 1-3 | Few entries, still learning | Treat as guidance, not authoritative. Say "Limited institutional memory for [domain]." |
| **ACTIVE** | 4-10 | Good coverage | Use confidently for pre-task scanning. Patterns are reliable. |
| **RICH** | 11+ | Strong institutional memory | High confidence. Patterns are battle-tested. Auto-reject known failures. |
