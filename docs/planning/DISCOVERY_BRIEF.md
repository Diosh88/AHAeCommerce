# Discovery Brief — AHAeCommerce

> Generated by initialize-governance v20.0 during Phase 0: Discovery
> Template Version: v2.0 (15-section Enterprise Discovery)
> This document feeds directly into Phase 1 (PRD creation) as structured context.

---

## 1. Identity

- **Project Name**: AHAeCommerce (ahaecommerce.com)
- **Project Type**: New Project (content/publishing platform — no code existed at init)
- **One-Sentence Description**: The A–Z eCommerce Decision and Execution Intelligence Platform — decision clarity, not information volume.
- **Primary User**: Early-to-mid stage eCommerce founder / solo operator overwhelmed by conflicting advice and poor decision clarity

---

## 2. Business Model

- **Revenue Model**: Multi-stream (blended — no single dominant stream)
- **Revenue Streams Identified**:
  1. **Ethical Affiliates** — Tool recommendations aligned to decision frameworks, not conversion optimization
  2. **Digital Products** — Frameworks, playbooks, decision templates, audit guides
  3. **Consulting / Audits** — Store architecture audits, stack reviews (optional backend)
  4. **Referral Partnerships** — Agency and service partner referrals (neutral basis)
  5. **Email** — Compounding owned audience (not a revenue stream itself — the distribution layer for all others)
- **Pricing Hypothesis**: Free content as primary driver; digital products $29–$199 range; consulting/audits $500–$2,000+ per engagement. Affiliate commissions reinvested into content depth, not volume.

---

## 3. Target Platform

- **Primary**: Web
- **Secondary**: Web + iOS + Android (future — not blocking initial build)
- **Mobile App Store Deployment**: Planned future (not initial scope)
- **Platform Compliance Required**: Web-first (App Store compliance future consideration)

---

## 4. Audience Classification

- **Application Type**: Customer-facing (public content platform)
- **If Both**: N/A — fully public content platform
- **User Technical Level**: Mixed (non-technical founders + semi-technical operators)
- **Usage Context**: Occasional (research-driven, decision-triggered reads — not daily-use dashboard)

---

## 5. Risk Tier Classification

> Drives: security gate strictness, testing requirements, compliance needs, governance weight.

- **Risk Tier**: MEDIUM
- **Classification Basis**: Basic accounts — names, emails, preferences (email subscribers, potential product purchasers, no payment data stored on-platform)

| Tier | Criteria | Gate Implications |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| LOW | No user data, personal tool, static content, internal utility | Minimal security gates, no compliance requirements |
| **MEDIUM** | **Basic accounts — names, emails, preferences** | **Standard auth, basic encryption, GDPR basics, Gate 3b 6/8 threshold** |
| HIGH | Payments, financial data, sensitive PII, health records | PCI/compliance, encryption at rest, audit logging, Gate 3b all 8 mandatory |
| CRITICAL | HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR-critical, financial regulatory | Full compliance suite, penetration testing, SOC 2, Gate 3b all 8 + no override |

---

## 6. Governance Scope

> Auto-inferred from risk tier + platform + audience + detected stack. Confirmed during Wave 3 output.

| Domain | Active? | Activation Rule |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Security | YES | Risk tier MEDIUM — user accounts, email capture |
| Performance | YES | Web platform — Core Web Vitals critical for SEO authority |
| Accessibility | YES | Public-facing UI — WCAG 2.1 AA minimum |
| i18n | NO | English-only initial scope — not indicated |
| SEO | YES | Customer-facing content platform — SEO is the primary acquisition channel |
| Design System | YES | UI-bearing content platform |
| Content Governance | YES | Content-first platform — every article must pass the Editorial Rule |
| Integration | YES | Email (ConvertKit/Beehiiv), affiliates, analytics — 2+ external services expected |

**Inactive domains**: i18n — governance gates marked N/A, not evaluated, not blocking.

---

## 7. Data Sensitivity

> Drives: auth requirements, encryption needs, compliance gates, RLS policy complexity.

- **Data Classification**: basic-PII
- **PII Types Present**: Names, emails, preferences (no financial data on-platform — Stripe or equivalent handles payments for digital products)
- **Regulatory Requirements**: GDPR basics (EU audience likely), CAN-SPAM for email
- **Data Residency Constraints**: None specified (Vercel/managed deployment handles this)

| Risk Tier | Data Classification | Minimum Auth | Encryption | RLS Required? |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| MEDIUM | basic-PII | Email+password or OAuth | Transport + at-rest for PII | Recommended |

---

## 8. Deployment Target

> Drives: CI/CD setup, environment management, cost architecture, rollback strategy.

- **Hosting Infrastructure**: Vercel (managed, serverless — confirmed by user)
- **CI/CD Target**: GitHub Actions (detected: git repo active, standard for Vercel deploys)
- **Environments**: Staging + Production (minimum)
- **Store Compliance**: Web only (App Store compliance deferred)
- **Detected Deployment Config**: None yet (no vercel.json, no Dockerfile — fresh project)
- **Detected CI/CD Config**: None yet (no .github/workflows — to be created during architecture/development)

---

## 9. External Integrations

> Drives: dependency mapping, failure mode planning, cost estimation, vendor lock-in assessment.

| Service | Category | Detected? | Criticality | Fallback Strategy |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Email Platform (ConvertKit / Beehiiv / Resend) | Email / List | Manual (expected) | High | Export list + alternate provider |
| Analytics (PostHog / Plausible / GA4) | Analytics | Manual (expected) | Medium | Local logs + manual review |
| Affiliate Network (ShareASale / Impact / direct) | Monetization | Manual (expected) | Medium | Direct partnership links |
| Payment Processor (Stripe / Lemon Squeezy) | Payments | Manual (expected) | High (digital products) | Alternate processor |
| Monitoring (Sentry) | Error Tracking | Manual (expected) | Medium | Console logging |

**Total Integration Count**: 5 (expected)
**Vendor Lock-in Risk**: LOW (all replaceable — no deep platform dependency)

> **Note**: No package.json detected at init — stack not yet chosen. Integrations are expected based on content platform patterns. Architecture phase will formalize selections.

---

## 11. Existing Artifacts Found

> Checked for presence of existing planning/architecture/design documents.

| Artifact | Found? | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| PRD / Requirements | NO | -- |
| Architecture Doc | NO | -- |
| Design Spec | NO | -- |
| Design-OS | NO | -- |
| Content Governance | NO | -- |
| Existing CLAUDE.md | NO | -- |
| Existing Registries | NO | -- |
| DISCOVERY.md | **YES** | `/DISCOVERY.md` — LOCKED, 13-section scope document |

> **Note**: DISCOVERY.md is a strong, locked Phase 0 document. Its scope lock, editorial rule, A–Z framework, and monetization alignment are all PRD-grade inputs. The PRD executor should treat it as primary discovery input, not supplementary.

---

## 12. Revenue Hypothesis

> Derived from business model answers. Input for Compound Business Checklist in Gate 1.

- **Primary Revenue Stream**: Ethical affiliate recommendations embedded in decision-framework content (evergreen, low-bias positioning)
- **Secondary Revenue Stream**: Digital products — decision frameworks, audit templates, playbooks (high-margin, no inventory)
- **Revenue at 10x Users**: Affiliate revenue scales linearly with traffic; digital products scale near-zero marginal cost; consulting/audits capacity-constrained (optional backend, not primary)
- **Growth Loop Hypothesis**: Content → SEO authority → audience → email list → digital products → word-of-mouth referrals (content loop, compounding)

---

## 13. Primary User Profile

> Sketch from discovery answers. Will be expanded into full personas during PRD (Phase 1).

- **Role**: Early-to-mid stage eCommerce founder / solo operator
- **Primary Goal**: Make confident, irreversible-mistake-avoiding decisions about platform, tools, team, and growth
- **Primary Pain**: Conflicting advice, biased content (affiliate-driven reviews), information without decision clarity — can't trust what they read
- **Usage Frequency**: Occasional (triggered by decision moments — "I need to choose a platform" / "Should I scale now?")
- **Device**: Mixed (mobile research during commute / discovery; desktop for deep reads)

### Secondary Users
- Consultants validating recommendations
- Agency partners seeking neutral explanations
- Educators and practitioners

---

## 14. Operational Complexity

> Drives: governance weight, DIOSH activation depth, machine role architecture, CI/CD requirements.

- **Team Size**: Solo developer
- **Development Workflow**: Solo-push (no PR review required initially — can evolve)
- **Machine Architecture**: Single-machine (M5 pattern via SyncNode detected — multi-machine capability available but not required for this project)
- **DIOSH Activation Level**: Light (solo tool — basic phase gates, no full DIOSH contracts required)

| Complexity | Team | Workflow | DIOSH Level |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | **Solo dev** | **Solo push** | **Light — basic phase gates, no DIOSH contracts** |
| Standard | Small team (2-5) | PR review | Standard — phase gates + DIOSH D-I-O-S-H contracts |
| Full | Multi-team / multi-machine | CI-gated pipeline | Full — all gates, DIOSH contracts, machine role enforcement |

---

## 15. Phase 0 Completion

- **Date**: 2026-02-28
- **Template Version**: v2.0
- **initialize-governance Version**: v20.0
- **Interview Questions Asked**: 6 (Wave 1-2 condensed: 3 questions, Wave 2.5: 3 questions — Wave 1 Q1/Q3/Q4 derived from DISCOVERY.md)
- **Auto-Detected Sections**: Sections 10, 11 (auto-populated from filesystem scan — no package.json found)
- **Pre-Existing Artifact**: DISCOVERY.md (Phase 0 equivalent — LOCKED, used as primary input)
- **Governance Scope Confirmed**: YES — auto-inferred scope presented and confirmed
- **Next Phase**: PRD (Phase 1)
- **Context for Phase 1**: This document (DISCOVERY_BRIEF.md) should be read as input context before creating the PRD. Pay special attention to:
  - Risk Tier (#5): MEDIUM — drives security architecture depth
  - Governance Scope (#6): SEO + Content Governance are PRIMARY domains (content authority platform)
  - Data Sensitivity (#7): basic-PII — standard auth + basic encryption required
  - Revenue Hypothesis (#12): Multi-stream with content loop — PRD must reflect all 5 streams with growth loop architecture
  - DISCOVERY.md: Read in full before PRD — the scope lock and A–Z framework are non-negotiable constraints
